# Define boundaries here. Properties:
#
# -- IDENTITY --
# id         id used in street data
# label      label to display (English fallback)
# spriteId   sprite id prefix, should append `-left` or `-right` to this unless
#            `sameOnBothSides` is true
#
# -- CHARACTERISTICS --
# hasFloors        (boolean) true if building can have multiple floors
# sameOnBothSides  (boolean) true if the same sprite is used both sides of the street
# repeatHalf       (boolean) true if half of the sprite is repeating and the other half anchors to street edge
#                            todo: better property name
# alignAtBaseline  (boolean) true if bottom of sprite should be anchored at baseline rather than ground plane
#
# -- SPECIFICATIONS --
# variantsCount    (number) actually, not sure
#                            guess: it varies the upper floor designs
# mainFloorHeight  (number) in meters, how tall is the ground floor
#                            todo: use pixel heights for these?
# floorHeight      (number) in meters, how tall are intermediate floors (which can repeat)
# roofHeight       (number) in meters, how tall is the roof structure
# overhangWidth    (number) in CSS pixels, amount to overhang the sidewalk (adjusts OVERHANG_WIDTH)
