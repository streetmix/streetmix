    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Switched our user analytics provider.</strong> We no longer feed the ad-beast that is Google (although they’re probably still tracking you in other ways outside of our control), opting to use the open source, privacy-minded <a href="https://plausible.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plausible</a> instead. Does this affect your usage of Streetmix? No, not really. So why is it a new feature? I mean. Like a better Internet <em>isn’t</em>?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🐛 Bug fixes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed a bug that caused manual width inputs on some segments to update the wrong segment. 😱
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🎮 UI improvements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        While fixing that last bug we also made some tweaks to how the input works:
        <ul>
          <li>The plus and minus buttons are now visually grouped with the input box and have been given a bit of a color scheme upgrade.</li>
          <li>Editing that input box no longer auto-updates the segment width visually, which was causing some unexpected issues with the input. We want to put it back eventually, once some underlying wrinkles have been ironed out!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Updates to French, Italian and Spanish (Latin America) translations.

    <h2>Service notice</h2>

    <p>
      In the past month, you might have seen a lot of scary-looking “Unable to load Streetmix, Error: RM1” error messages when returning to Streetmix, forcing you to log in more than once.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was inadvertently caused a behind-the-scenes update we made to make authentication more secure, but by replacing an older process, it introduced side effects and bugs that took some time to track down and squash.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of today, we think we’ve resolved most cases of this problem. A few accounts may still have lingering issues, and if you’re affected, try reloading the browser tab and logging in again.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are someone who continues to see this problem repeatedly, then we want to know more about your situation. In that case, please reach out to at <a href="mailto:hello@streetmix.net">hello@streetmix.net</a> and tell us more.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are continuing to monitor the errors and apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Thank you!

    <h2>Service notice</h2>

    <p>
      We’ve upgraded our sign-in authentication system behind the scenes. As a side effect of the update, we had to sign everyone out of Streetmix. You may see a cryptic error message the next time you return (if not already!). When this happens, please reload the page and sign in again! Thanks!

    <h2>✨ New features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Added historical European-style arcade buildings.</strong> No, not like, video game arcades. A series of arches. Actually, there’s some really interesting history with that word: it used to mean a building façade with a series of exterior arches that formed a semi-open but protected walkway that made it ideal for shops and games for “amusement”, but then over time as these retail uses moved indoors they were still called arcades even if they didn't use arches anymore, and then when the “amusement centres” inside of arcades got digital gaming machines they were called <em>arcade games</em> and the venues themselves became <em>arcades</em> and that’s what we think of when we say that word now. Oh, and did you know that the word <em>arch</em> is itself derived from <em>architecture</em> because they literally had no other word for a curved structural element? Language is fascinating!

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Buttons universally have rounded corners now.</strong> Like your house chores, we were eventually getting to all of them. And with that done, we’ve fired our entire user interface engineering team for that terrible toast pun.

        <strong>Added temporary barriers, like traffic cones, barricades, and jersey barriers.</strong> We can see what’s happening from our second-story bedroom window. No one’s outside. No one’s driving anywhere. And if you’re on a vehicle that helps you stay away from other people &mdash; a bicycle, perhaps? &mdash; where are you going to ride it, in the ample car lane that suddenly has way less cars in it? Yeah. We thought so. Here, some of these traffic cones might help.

    <h2>🛠️ Improvements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>We’ve completed our migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL.</strong> Wait, what? Okay, look, this is too cool not to talk about. We’ve been working on changing our database behind-the-scenes for years now, and today, it’s finally done. <em>And you didn’t even notice!</em> It’s like we changed all the upholstery in your car, while you were driving it, and suddenly you look down and not only does it look nicer and cost less to maintain, but it is also, weirdly enough, a <em>map</em>. (This enables better geospatial support, so stay tuned!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🐛 Bug fixes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where typing a capital-letter D in the e-mail sign-in input (or anywhere, really), would give you TMI about application state.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where the gallery would crash if you opened it right away.</li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added a motorcycle with sidecar to the drive lane.</strong> And introducing a cameo by <a href="http://kentuckyroutezero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Junebug and Johnny</a>. (Note: only available for signed-in users.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added languages: Italian, Korean, and Latin American Spanish.</strong> <em>Cin cin!</em> <em>건배!</em> <em>¡Salud!</em> The latter is especially important, as we can now support a much larger community of Spanish speakers throughout all of Latin America. Many thanks to our translators, Enrico Ferreguti, Sunha Park, and Lina Marcela Quiñones, with reviewers Marco Scarselli, Hanbyul Jo, and Carlos Pardo.

        <ul>
          <li>The selected street now has a more visible border, making it easier to see.</li>
          <li>The “Delete street” button has been relocated to make room for longer street names, and changed from an “x” symbol to a more context-sensitive trash can icon.</li>
          <li>Thumbnails that cannot be rendered (for instance, because the street contains data that hasn’t been implemented yet) now show an error message in place of the thumbnail, instead of crashing the entire gallery component.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🐛 Bug fixes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where attempting to make a copy of a deleted street would crash the app.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where the current street would not be shown as selected when opening the street gallery.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where capacity count summaries would not be localized.</li>
      <li>Fixed broken right-to-left layout in the street gallery.</li>
      <li>Fixed certain styling issues that would occur as a result of rounding errors.</li>

        <strong>We made this “What’s new” box.</strong> Now you know that when something
        changes, we did it on purpose!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added “flex zone” items,</strong> which are modern uses of curb space
        that include taxi and rideshare pickup/dropoff, food trucks, bikeshare stations,
        and a waiting area where a guy just stands around looking at his modern portable device.

      <li>
        <strong>Tooltips on the street component palette</strong> now help you differentiate
        between all the cars that look the same.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fixed a crash bug</strong> that sometimes happens right after moving
        a street component around, which is literally the worst time for it to crash.

        <strong>Filled in the backstory in this “What’s new” window.</strong> None of this text
        actually existed at this time, but think of it like we’re writing a prequel.
