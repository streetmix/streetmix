## How do I provide attribution to Streetmix? {#attribution}

When you reuse or republish Streetmix content, you should include the following messaging:

- That you created this content with Streetmix
- That the content is licensed under Creative Commons (or the AGPL license, if the reproduction includes code)
- Include a link to Streetmix ([https://streetmix.net/](https://streetmix.net/))

We are flexible with attribution. You may be in a situation where you're not able to include all or some of those things. That's okay! But you may not _choose_ not to provide attribution. This is theft. Please use your best judgment about what form of attribution is viable for you.

## Can I copy the Streetmix code or set up my own instance?

## Does Streetmix support Internet Explorer? {#internet-explorer}

Our unique interface means Streetmix is designed with the most recent web technology in mind. We chose not to support Internet Explorer early on, and this browser has reached the end of its official support from Microsoft in June 2022. If you are on a Windows device please use the [Microsoft Edge browser](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) instead, or one of the common "evergreen" browsers [Chrome, Firefox, and Safari](https://browsehappy.com/).

## How do you add setback lines or curb-to-curb widths?

This is not currently possible in Streetmix. We designed Streetmix for a lay audience, who may not be fully aware of all the fixed constraints of street design. As a result, we decided not complicate the user interface with setbacks or curb-to-curb dimensions, focusing instead on space between buildings, which is what people experience every day. We plan to add these features in the future for a professional version of Streetmix.

## How do you lock down parts of a street to prevent users from editing them?

We believe that civic engagement is most empowering when users are not artificially constrained from expressing their creativity or their opinions. Instead, we believe users should be educated about constraints and be given the right to accept or reject them. Furthermore, a digital sandbox is the perfect environment to experiment with concepts that might be impossible or unrealistic in real life.

## Can you add X feature?

We'll see! Please [contact us](/community). We can't respond to all requests, but we do read and consider all user suggestions to help prioritize new features in Streetmix.
