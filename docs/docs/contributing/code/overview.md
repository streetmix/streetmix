# Code contributions

If you have the capacity to write code, and wish to contribute to Streetmix, we'd love your help! **No patch is too small.** We welcome patches to fix typos, add comments, or refactor code.

We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to make changes and proposals to our codebase.

## Before you begin

Before writing any new feature or code, it's best to have a brief conversation with the Streetmix team to make sure we're all on the same page. Please check [GitHub issues](https://github.com/streetmix/streetmix/issues) to see if a feature is already being discussed or worked on, and comment there to register your interest. If it hasn't been discussed, please feel free to open a new issue for it.

You can also [join our Discord server](https://strt.mx/discord) and talk with us there. A little bit of communication will go a long way, making it more likely that we're able to accept your work when it's ready!

## Submitting a pull request {#pull-request}

1. **Fork the project**, if you do not already have write access to the repository. Individuals making significant and valuable contributions will be given write access.
2. **Create a new branch.** Changes should always be made in a new feature branch. The branch should be named in the format `username/feature-name`.
3. **Implement your feature or bug fix.** Writing code is the fun part Before you start any work, it's a good idea to talk to the team first, so that we can be sure you're on the right track.
4. **Commit your changes.** Commit messages should follow [semantic commit message format](styleguide#code-commit-style). When committing, we use hooks to run code style linting. If it fails, please correct (or override) the code and commit again.
5. **Push your changes.** After pushing, we run continuous integration tests in the cloud to make sure commits pass. We recommend manually [running tests locally](reference/tests#running-tests) as well.
6. **Submit a pull request.** Ideally, pull requests contain small, self-contained changes with a few commits, which are easier to review. You can simplify a review and merge process by making sure your branch contains no conflicts with the `main` branch and is up-to-date (either by rebasing on `main` or merging it in) when the pull request is created. If the pull request addresses an open issue, be sure to reference it in your request's title or description.
7. **Wait for a review.** A project maintainer will review your pull request and either approve, reject, or request changes on it. A well-written, small pull request that fixes an open issue is most likely to be approved and merged quickly. Once merged, a branch is deleted.

Stale branches, especially ones that cannot be cleanly merged anymore, are likely to be deleted after some amount of time has passed.
