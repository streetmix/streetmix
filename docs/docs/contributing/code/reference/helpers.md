# Helpers and utilities

This page is a work in progress.

We use the following utilities to solve common programming problems.

## Pseudo-random number generator

If you need a one-time use random number (which will never be stored), there's nothing wrong with JavaScript's built-in `Math.random()`. However, there are times where we need a **seed** for a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). Seeds generate a random-_looking_ sequence of numbers, but they have the benefit of remaining consistent across renders. For example, this is useful on our sidewalk segment, where we want to generate a random set of pedestrians but we want those pedestrians to remain the same between page refreshes or React component updates.

We can generate seeds by calling `generateRandSeed()`, then by feeding those seeds into the `seedrandom` library:

```js title="random-example.js"
import seedrandom from "seedrandom";
import { generateRandSeed } from "./util/random";

function doThingsWithThePRNG() {
  const seed = generateRandSeed();
  const prng1 = seedrandom(seed);

  // Generate pseudo-random numbers. Each time rng() is called, it returns
  // the next pseudo-random number in the sequence.
  console.log(prng1()); // -> first pseudo-random number
  console.log(prng1()); // -> second pseudo-random number
  // .. etc

  // Create another generator with the same seed
  const prng2 = seedrandom(seed);
  console.log(prng2()); // -> same value as the first call to prng1()
}
```

When `seedrandom()` is called, it returns a function that will return a consistent sequence of numbers each time it is called, for the given `seed`. The sequence returned is local to that function.

:::note

Although the `seed` can be any type of value, like a string, `generateRandSeed()` returns only integer values so that when we store seeds in a data model we can check for type consistency.

:::

In the above example, we call `seedrandom()` twice, with the same `seed`, so that we can create the same sequence of pseudo-random numbers in two different scenarios. This example is contrived because the pseudo-random number generators are used in the same function, and in reality the `seedrandom()` call may happen in separate parts of the application.

## axios

The [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library was introduced as a recommendation over native `fetch` as a way to manage requests to the Streetmix back-end API layer. Additionally, Axios Mock Adapter offers the possibility to mock all API requests for integration testing.

If you work on API-related features, consider refactoring the `fetch` calls to use the API in `.assets/scripts/util/api.js`.
