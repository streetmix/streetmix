# Sign up for Streetmix+ (beta)

Streetmix is an ad-free, spyware-free, and free-to-use platform that makes street design available to anyone in the world, and you can help us keep it that way! When you sign up for **Streetmix+**, a membership-based monthly subscription, you can help support our hosting costs and ongoing development. In return, members also get exclusive access to new and improved features in Streetmix!

:::info

**Streetmix+ is in early beta.** We are still experimenting and building out the infrastructure to make membership seamless and easy to join. Please pardon our dust and we thank you for your patience as we work out the kinks!

:::

## Features

Here's some of the features that are currently available to Streetmix+ members, with more to come!

- Rename street segments
- Change environmental backgrounds
- Export images without watermark
- Export images at print-ready resolutions
- New segments: double decker bus, microvan, and autonomous shuttles
- Unlimited streets (Technically, everyone does have unlimited streets already, but this creates some data storage problems on our end, so we need to start setting caps. We'll do this in a fair way. Stay tuned for more.)
- **Coming soon:** Member-only Discord community

Streetmix+ members will also be able to help us prioritize future features to come!

## Signing up

You can sign up for Streetmix+ membership through multiple platforms:

### OpenCollective

[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/streetmix) is a platform where individuals can support open source projects such as Streetmix. Both monthly and yearly memberships are available. **We prefer OpenCollective because funds received through this platform can be used by Streetmix immediately, compared to other support platforms.**

Streetmix+ membership does not activate immediately (_this is something we're working on!_). If the e-mail address you have at OpenCollective matches the one you use to log into Streetmix, we will be able to activate Streetmix+ within one week.

If you do not use e-mail login, or you used a different e-mail address on OpenCollective, we will reach out to you to ask for Streetmix account information. For fastest results, you can [e-mail us proactively](mailto:hello@streetmix.net) with a copy of your payment receipt and your username on Streetmix. **Please note that if you sign up using a guest account or an organization account on OpenCollective, we will not be provided with your contact information, so you _must_ e-mail us first.** To claim an already-created guest account, [you can follow these instructions](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/payments#claiming-a-guest-account).

:::caution About organization accounts

Organization accounts are [a specific account type on the OpenCollective platform](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/financial-contributors/organizations), not an account type on Streetmix. Streetmix+ features will still be assigned to an individual account on Streetmix. If you subscribe with an organization, please [reach out to us](mailto:hello@streetmix.net) with that individual's Streetmix account details.

:::

If you have previously been an OpenCollective contributor, we can credit your account for an equivalent amount of time. Please contact us at hello@streetmix.net with the information above.

Streetmix+ membership does not activate immediately (_this is something we're working on!_), but someone on our team will reach out to you to activate Streetmix+ on your Streetmix account within one week. If you do not hear from us, please contact us at hello@streetmix.net.

### Coil

:::caution Deprecated

**Coil support is deprecated.** [Coil has sunsetted its products](https://coil.com/) as of February 2, 2023 and are no longer existing new member sign-ups. The service will be discontinued for all existing users on March 15, 2023.

Streetmix+ subscribers using the Coil plugin will continue to receive benefits until it is completely discontinued. We encourage all existing Coil users to migrate to OpenCollective or Patreon as early as possible.

:::

You may also sign up for Streetmix+ membership through [Coil](https://coil.com/). Built on the open [Web Monetization protocol](https://webmonetization.org/), Coil subscribers automatically get access to Streetmix+ membership, as well as many other services across the web. Here's how to sign up and activate Streetmix+ through Coil.

1. **[Sign up or log in to an existing account through Coil](https://coil.com/).** A Coil membership is only $5 / month.
2. **Install the Coil Browser Extension.** It works for all major browsers!
3. **Enjoy Streetmix+!** Make sure you're signed your Streetmix user account while the extension is active. The Coil icon should show a solid green circle, and you will see a "Thank you!" message like this when you click on it:

![Menu bar with Streetmix+ icon](/img/streetmix-plus/coil-thank-you.png)

If you have issues with Coil, please see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-coil) section below.

## Confirming your membership

When your Streetmix+ membership is active, you'll see an icon beside your user account name, like this:

## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble accessing Streetmix+ features, here are some troubleshooting tips.

### Troubleshooting OpenCollective

If you have signed up for a Streetmix+ membership but have not been contacted about activating it, please e-mail us at hello@streetmix.net. This may happen for the following reasons:

- You have been a contributor since before August 2022. We are slowly reaching out to existing contributors to set up access.
- You may have signed up for OpenCollective using a guest account. Unfortunately we have no way of contacting people with guest accounts. In order to verify that you are subscribing, please set up an OpenCollective account.
- Please allow up to one week if you have recently signed up. We appreciate the patience!

### Troubleshooting Coil

:::caution Deprecated

**Coil support is deprecated.** [Coil has sunsetted its products](https://coil.com/) as of February 2, 2023 and are no longer existing new member sign-ups. The service will be discontinued for all existing users on March 15, 2023.

:::

- **Make sure that the Coil Browser Extension is installed and active.**
  - You should see a Coil browser extension in the menu bar of your browser. If you don't see it, check your browser's extensions.
  - You should be logged into your Coil account in the same browser. If you're not logged in, clicking the extension icon in your browser menu bar should prompt you to log in.
  - You should see a solid green circle on the extension icon, like this: ![Menu bar with Streetmix+ icon](/img/streetmix-plus/coil-extension-active.png)
  - If you see an outlined green circle that never turns solid, like this: ![Menu bar with Streetmix+ icon](/img/streetmix-plus/coil-extension-pending.png) That means you have logged in, but it's stuck in a "pending" state. That might mean your network is blocking connections that prevent Streetmix from interacting with Coil. In this situation, Coil may not be the best option for you to access Streetmix+. Please try the [OpenCollective](#opencollective) or [Patreon](#patreon) options above, and for further assistance, reach out to hello@streetmix.net.
