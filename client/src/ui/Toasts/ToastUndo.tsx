  // The "undo" button always undoes the last action. If this toast
  // is still visible, and a user makes additional edits to the street,
  // the undo button will revert the last edit, not the action that
  // triggered this toast.
  // A previous solution was to hide this toast when the street is
  // updated and saved, but this has been broken in the react-spring toast
  // implementation for some time.
  // A new solution is to know which undo step triggered the toast,
  // and if the undo action is still relevant, it is performed when clicked.
  // Otherwise the undo action is rendered inert.
  // We can't do this right now because undos don't have an ID to key off of.
