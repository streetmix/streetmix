SVGs added here will be compiled to `/build/illustrations.svg` and loaded into the app via `/assets/illustrations.svg`. The file contains symbol sprites with the same naming convention as the Streetmix illustrations package (https://github.com/streetmix/illustrations#readme). Similar to that package, you can namespace illustrations by putting them into sub-directories. This directory allows you to easily add new images for testing or to extend Streetmix without needing to make changes to the illustrations package.
