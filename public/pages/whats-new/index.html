    <h1>May 7, 2020</h1>

    <h2>New features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Added historical European-style arcade buildings.</strong> No, not like, video game arcades. A series of arches. Actually, there’s some really interesting history with that word: it used to mean a building façade with a series of exterior arches that formed a semi-open but protected walkway that made it ideal for shops and games for “amusement”, but then over time as these retail uses moved indoors they were still called arcades even if they didn't use arches anymore, and then when the “amusement centres” inside of arcades got digital gaming machines they were called <em>arcade games</em> and the venues themselves became <em>arcades</em> and that’s what we think of when we say that word now. Oh, and did you know that the word <em>arch</em> is itself derived from <em>architecture</em> because they literally had no other word for a curved structural element? Language is fascinating!

    <h1>April 18, 2020</h1>

    <h2>UI improvements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Upgraded “toast” notifications.</strong> Did you know they’re called “toasts” because ... they <em>pop up?</em> Haha! Get it?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Buttons universally have rounded corners now.</strong> Like your house chores, we were eventually getting to all of them. And with that done, we’ve fired our entire user interface engineering team for that terrible toast pun.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <article>
    <h1>April 16, 2020</h1>

    <h2>New features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Planting strips now grow more bushes and (colorful!) flowers.</strong>
        You know what they say about April showers...
        <img src="flowers.png" alt="Flowers!" />

  <article>
    <h1>April 8, 2020</h1>

    <h2>New features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>People can now walk around in the street.</strong> Quarantine Update Part II is brought to you by empty streets, fresher air, and cabin fever. Everywhere’s a walking path now. Social distancing not included: please continue to stay two meters (six feet) away from each other outside, but here in Streetmix-land we can still dream, can’t we?
        <img src="street-people.png" alt="Occupy Any Street" />
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bug fixes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Temporary barriers no longer display a different item when dragging one out of the palette.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h1>April 2, 2020</h1>

    <h2>New features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Added temporary barriers, like traffic cones, barricades, and jersey barriers.</strong> We can see what’s happening from our second-story bedroom window. No one’s outside. No one’s driving anywhere. And if you’re on a vehicle that helps you stay away from other people &mdash; a bicycle, perhaps? &mdash; where are you going to ride it, in the ample car lane that suddenly has way less cars in it? Yeah. We thought so. Here, some of these traffic cones might help.
        <img src="temporary-barriers.png" alt="Jersey barriers, barricades, and traffic cones, oh my" />
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UI improvements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Segments (and its variants) that require sign-in to use are now shown when signed out.</strong> If you don’t have an account yet, we’re cranking up your FOMO.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bug fixes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where some users had features incorrectly turned off in their account.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h1>March 19, 2020</h1>

    <h2>Improvements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>We’ve completed our migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL.</strong> Wait, what? Okay, look, this is too cool not to talk about. We’ve been working on changing our database behind-the-scenes for years now, and today, it’s finally done. <em>And you didn’t even notice!</em> It’s like we changed all the upholstery in your car, while you were driving it, and suddenly you look down and not only does it look nicer and cost less to maintain, but it is also, weirdly enough, a <em>map</em>. (This enables better geospatial support, so stay tuned!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bug fixes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where typing a capital-letter D in the e-mail sign-in input (or anywhere, really), would give you TMI about application state.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where the gallery would crash if you opened it right away.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h1>March 11, 2020</h1>

    <h2>New features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Raised bike lanes!</strong> All right, you can ride your bike on the sidewalk. Watch out for those pedestrians, though!</li>
      <li><strong>...also for bike share stations!</strong> These are also often on the sidewalk, too!</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h1>January 29, 2020</h1>

    <h2>New features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Added an outbound autonomous vehicle illustration.</strong> When you hate to see them go, but you love to watch them drive away. (Note: only available for signed-in users.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added a motorcycle with sidecar to the drive lane.</strong> And introducing a cameo by <a href="http://kentuckyroutezero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Junebug and Johnny</a>. (Note: only available for signed-in users.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Added languages: Italian, Korean, and Latin American Spanish.</strong> <em>Cin cin!</em> <em>건배!</em> <em>¡Salud!</em> The latter is especially important, as we can now support a much larger community of Spanish speakers throughout all of Latin America. Many thanks to our translators, Enrico Ferreguti, Sunha Park, and Lina Marcela Quiñones, with reviewers Marco Scarselli, Hanbyul Jo, and Carlos Pardo.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UI improvements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Remodeled the personal street gallery interface.</strong> Some notable changes:
        <ul>
          <li>The selected street now has a more visible border, making it easier to see.</li>
          <li>The “Delete street” button has been relocated to make room for longer street names, and changed from an “x” symbol to a more context-sensitive trash can icon.</li>
          <li>Thumbnails that cannot be rendered (for instance, because the street contains data that hasn’t been implemented yet) now show an error message in place of the thumbnail, instead of crashing the entire gallery component.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bug fixes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug where attempting to make a copy of a deleted street would crash the app.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where the current street would not be shown as selected when opening the street gallery.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where capacity count summaries would not be localized.</li>
      <li>Fixed broken right-to-left layout in the street gallery.</li>
      <li>Fixed certain styling issues that would occur as a result of rounding errors.</li>
    </ul>

  <article>
    <h1>January 18, 2020</h1>

    <h2>New features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Users in any language can now sign in with e-mail, Facebook and Google single-sign-on options, in addition to Twitter. (Although they haven't all been translated yet.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>UI improvements</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>New UI font!</strong> If you’re into typography, say hello to <a href="https://hubertfischer.com/work/type-rubik" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rubik</a> by <a href="https://hubertfischer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hubert & Fischer</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bug fixes</h2> 

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a regression that caused a crash whenever a new segment was dragged out from the palette.</li>
      <li>Fixed a regression where streets would show a “Updated seconds ago” timestamp when being edited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>January 8, 2020</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Happy new year!</strong> We have a few updates!
    </p>

    <h2>New features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>We added a variant of turn lane that has all three left turn, right turn and straight arrows. They're uncommon, but they do exist in the wild!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bug fixes</h2> 

    <ul>
      <li>We fixed a bug that could cause a browser to navigate forward or back a page if you scrolled too far on a wide street.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Autonomous vehicles!</strong> The car of the future? Look, you decide. Drive lanes now have a cute, friendly “Firefly”-inspired model as an option. They don’t exist anymore, but we’ll still know what you mean.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Magic carpets!</strong> Speaking about fantasy vehicles <em>(oooh, sick burn)</em>, why not a rug that hovers in the air, carrying a maximum of two people and a tiger? (The tiger is optional.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Street capacity summaries.</strong> And while we’re on the subject of capacity, lanes now estimate how many people you can push through per hour. With charts! (Tigers not included.)
      </li>
    </ul>
