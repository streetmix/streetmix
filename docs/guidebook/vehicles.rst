.. note ::

   Although pedestrians have a definition in NUMO's vehicle attribute framework, individual persons — including those using wheeled mobility aids such as wheelchairs — are not classified in Streetmix as vehicles. Instead, we use the placeholder concept of "the pedestrian mode of travel" rather than individual persons representing a pedestrian "vehicle."
