# Sign up for Streetmix+ (beta)

Streetmix is an ad-free, spyware-free, and free-to-use platform that makes street design available to anyone in the world, and you can help us keep it that way! When you sign up for **Streetmix+**, a membership-based monthly subscription, you can help support our hosting costs and ongoing development. In return, members also get exclusive access to new and improved features in Streetmix!

:::info

**Streetmix+ is in early beta.** We are still experimenting and building out the infrastructure to make membership seamless and easy to join. Please pardon our dust and we thank you for your patience as we work out the kinks!

## Features

Here's some of the features that are currently available to Streetmix+ members, with more to come!

- Rename street segments
- Change environmental backgrounds
- Export images without watermark
- Export images at print-ready resolutions
- New segments: double decker bus, microvan, and autonomous shuttles
- Unlimited streets (Technically, everyone does have unlimited streets already, but this creates some data storage problems on our end, so we need to start setting caps. We'll do this in a fair way. Stay tuned for more.)
- **Coming soon:** Member-only Discord community

Streetmix+ members will also be able to help us prioritize future features to come!

## Signing up

You can sign up for Streetmix+ membership through multiple platforms:

### OpenCollective

[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/streetmix) is a platform where individuals and organizations can support open source projects such as Streetmix. Both monthly and yearly memberships are available. **We prefer OpenCollective because funds received through this platform can be used by Streetmix immediately, compared to other support platforms.**

Streetmix+ membership does not activate immediately (_this is something we're working on!_), but someone on our team will reach out to you to activate Streetmix+ on your Streetmix account within one week. If you do not hear from us, or if you are a past or current OpenCollective contributor, please contact us at hello@streetmix.net.

### Patreon

[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/streetmix) is a great option for members that are already supporting other artists or creators on Patreon.

Streetmix+ membership does not activate immediately (_this is something we're working on!_), but someone on our team will reach out to you to activate Streetmix+ on your Streetmix account within one week. If you do not hear from us, please contact us at hello@streetmix.net.

### GitHub Sponsors

### Coil

:::caution Deprecated

**Coil support is becoming deprecated.** Some users are experiencing issues connecting through the Coil plugin, and our team is also experiencing problems collecting funds through the Coil ecosystem. As a result, we are beginning the process of deprecating Coil support and encourage users to try OpenCollective or other platforms listed above.

If Coil already works for you, you will continue to receive Streetmix+ benefits through it until further notice.

:::

You may also sign up for Streetmix+ membership through [Coil](https://coil.com/). Built on the open [Web Monetization protocol](https://webmonetization.org/), Coil subscribers automatically get access to Streetmix+ membership, as well as many other services across the web. Here's how to sign up and activate Streetmix+ through Coil.

1. **[Sign up or log in to an existing account through Coil](https://coil.com/).** A Coil membership is only $5 / month.
2. **Install the Coil Browser Extension.** It works for all major browsers!
3. **Enjoy Streetmix+!** Make sure you're signed your Streetmix user account while the extension is active. The Coil icon should show a solid green circle, and you will see a "Thank you!" message like this when you click on it:

![Menu bar with Streetmix+ icon](/img/streetmix-plus/coil-thank-you.png)

If you have issues with Coil, please see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-coil) section below.

## Confirming your membership

When your Streetmix+ membership is active, you'll see an icon beside your user account name, like so:

## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble accessing Streetmix+ features, here are some troubleshooting tips.

### Troubleshooting OpenCollective

If you have signed up for a Streetmix+ membership but have not been contacted about activating it, please e-mail us at hello@streetmix.net. This may happen for the following reasons:

- You have been a contributor since before August 2022. We are slowly reaching out to existing contributors to set up access.
- You may have signed up for OpenCollective using a guest account. Unfortunately we have no way of contacting people with guest accounts. In order to verify that you are subscribing, please set up an OpenCollective account.
- Please allow up to one week if you have recently signed up. We appreciate the patience!

:::

- **Make sure that the Coil Browser Extension is installed and active.**
  - You should see a Coil browser extension in the menu bar of your browser. If you don't see it, check your browser's extensions.
  - You should be logged into your Coil account in the same browser. If you're not logged in, clicking the extension icon in your browser menu bar should prompt you to log in.
  - You should see a solid green circle on the extension icon, like this: ![Menu bar with Streetmix+ icon](/img/streetmix-plus/coil-extension-active.png)
  - If you see an outlined green circle that never turns solid, like this: ![Menu bar with Streetmix+ icon](/img/streetmix-plus/coil-extension-pending.png) That means you have logged in, but it's stuck in a "pending" state. That might mean your network is blocking connections that prevent Streetmix from interacting with Coil. In this situation, Coil may not be the best option for you to access Streetmix+. Please try the [OpenCollective](#opencollective) or [Patreon](#patreon) options above, and for further assistance, reach out to hello@streetmix.net.
