# Sign up for Streetmix+

Streetmix is an ad-free and free-to-use platform that makes street design available to anyone in the world, and you can help us keep it that way! Sign up for **Streetmix+**, a membership-based monthly subscription tier, to support hosting costs and ongoing development. Members will also get exclusive access to new and improved features in Streetmix!

_Streetmix+ is currently in early beta._

## Features

Here's some of the features that are currently available to Streetmix+ members, with more to come!

- Rename street segments
- Change environmental backgrounds
- Export images without watermark
- New segments: double decker bus, microvan, and autonomous shuttles
- Unlimited streets (Technically, everyone does have unlimited streets already, but this creates some data storage problems on our end, so we need to start setting caps. We'll do this in a fair way. Stay tuned for more.)
- **Coming soon:** Export images at print-ready resolutions
- **Coming soon:** Member-only Discord community

Streetmix+ members will also be able to help us prioritize future features to come!

## Signing up

You can sign up for Streetmix+ membership through multiple platforms:

### OpenCollective

[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/streetmix) is a platform where individuals and organizations can support open source projects such as Streetmix. Both monthly and yearly memberships are available. **We prefer OpenCollective because funds received through this platform can be used by Streetmix immediately, compared to other support platforms.**

Streetmix+ membership does not activate immediately (_this is something we're working on!_), but someone on our team will reach out to you to activate Streetmix+ on your Streetmix account within one week. If you do not hear from us, or if you are a past or current OpenCollective contributor, please contact us at hello@streetmix.net.

### Patreon

[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/streetmix) is a great option for members that are already supporting other artists or creators on Patreon.

### GitHub Sponsors

### Coil

You may also sign up for Streetmix+ membership through [Coil](https://coil.com/). Built on the open [Web Monetization protocol](https://webmonetization.org/), Coil subscribers automatically get access to Streetmix+ membership, as well as many other services across the web. Here's how to sign up and activate Streetmix+ through Coil.

1. **[Sign up or log in to an existing account through Coil](https://coil.com/).** A Coil membership is only $5 / month.
2. **Install the Coil Browser Extension.** It works for all major browsers!
3. **Enjoy Streetmix+!** Make sure you're signed your Streetmix user account while the extension is active. The Coil icon should show a solid green circle, and you will see a "Thank you!" message like this when you click on it:

![Menu bar with Streetmix+ icon](/img/streetmix-plus/coil-thank-you.png)

If you have issues with Coil, please see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-coil) section below.

## Confirming your membership

When your Streetmix+ membership is active, you'll see an icon beside your user account name, like so:

## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble accessing Streetmix+ features, here are some troubleshooting tips.

### Troubleshooting Coil

- **Make sure that the Coil Browser Extension is installed and active.**
  - You should see a Coil browser extension in the menu bar of your browser. If you don't see it, check your browser's extensions.
  - You should be logged into your Coil account in the same browser. If you're not logged in, clicking the extension icon in your browser menu bar should prompt you to log in.
  - You should see a solid green circle on the extension icon, like this: ![Menu bar with Streetmix+ icon](/img/streetmix-plus/coil-extension-active.png)
  - If you see an outlined green circle that never turns solid, like this: ![Menu bar with Streetmix+ icon](/img/streetmix-plus/coil-extension-pending.png) That means you have logged in, but it's stuck in a "pending" state. That might mean your network is blocking connections that prevent Streetmix from interacting with Coil. In this situation, Coil may not be the best option for you to access Streetmix+. Please try the [OpenCollective](#opencollective) or [Patreon](#patreon) options above, and for further assistance, reach out to hello@streetmix.net.
