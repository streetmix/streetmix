# Translations

We're translating Streetmix into different languages! As a civic engagement tool, we are constantly improving accessibility to users of different needs, and this includes communities that speak a language other than English. Some of these communities may be in predominantly English-speaking countries like the United States, but we also have users all over the world in predominantly non-English speaking countries, as well.

The bulk of our translation work is contributed by volunteers who are fluent in those languages. If you would like to join us, please review this translator guide, [join our Discord](https://strt.mx/discord), and [send us an email](mailto:hello@streetmix.net).

We are always on the lookout for new translators!
