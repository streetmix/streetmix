    // 2083 as this is the maximum length supported by IE. Despite this, it
    // should be reasonable to expect that the URLs in this particular use case
    // would not be longer than 1024 characters. See the issue at

    // definition, with a maximum value of 255 characters.
    //
    // Be aware that this will cause data loss if there is a URL longer than
    // 255 characters, as we will have to truncate it in order to restore the
    // original column length.
    //
    // According to PostgreSQL documentation:
    // "An attempt to store a longer string into a column of these types will
    // result in an error, unless the excess characters are all spaces, in
    // which case the string will be truncated to the maximum length. (This
    // somewhat bizarre exception is required by the SQL standard.)"
    // https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-character.html
    //
    // Thus, this migration reversal requires two steps, wrapped in a
    // transaction for safety:
    // 1. First, we manually truncate all URLs longer than 255 to 255.
    // 2. Then, we change the column type to the original length.
    //
    // Apologies for the raw SQL. If Sequelize has an interface for this query,
    // please do replace.
