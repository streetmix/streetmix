Frequently asked questions
==========================

.. note::

   This page is in progress and will be updated as questions come in.


For general language guidance, please refer to our :ref:`content styleguide <content-styleguide>`.

**Q: Should we use formal or informal language in the translations?**

**A:** Use a tone that is friendly and open. This generally tilts toward informal, but as the translator, you can decide what would work best in your language. Please be consistent across strings and add comments to explain your choices when necessary.

**Q: When do I capitalize strings?**

**A:** Please capitalize only the first letter of a phrase/sentence unless it's a proper noun. See :ref:`here <sentence-case>` for more detail.

**Q: When do I add a period at the end of a string?**

**A:** The translated string's final punctuation mark (or lack thereof) should match the source English entry in Transifex. If your language has different rules, please bring it up in our Discord server so we can make a note of this in Transifex.

**Q: In my language, action buttons can use either the infinitive form or the conjugated command form of a verb (e.g. "Guardar imagen" o "Guarda imagen" in Spanish). Which form should I use?**

**A:** Please choose the form that you think communicates a friendly tone and then be consistent with your choice. If you disagree with prior decisions, please :ref:`report an issue <reporting-issues>` on the string.

**Q: What if I find a link to an English website in a string?**

**A:** Please add "(en)" in your translation so the user knows it's in English. If you have an equivalent link in your language, please create an issue so we can get it added in. Some links are handled through code — don't worry about those.

**Q: What are these "strings" you keep mentioning?**

**A:** Strings are chunks of text in the user interface that we need to translate. For definitions of other jargon you may encounter while translating, see the :ref:`glossary <translation-glossary>`.
