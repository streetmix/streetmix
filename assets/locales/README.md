# Locale files: do not edit!

Locale files are automatically generated! Do not edit these manually.

There is one exception: the `en` translations are the source language for all translatable strings, so this can be modified as needed.

For more information, see [the translation technical manual in documentation](https://docs.streetmix.net/contributing/code/reference/i18n).
